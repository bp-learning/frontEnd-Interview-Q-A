## 1.) What are meta tags in HTML ?

---

## 1.) What are meta tags in HTML ?

+ Meta tags are those tags which go inside the Head tag of the HTML page
+ Meta tags are not for the interface they are important for the browser. 
+ Meta Tags are always in name or value pairs 
+ Meta tags consist of character encoding, title, or even description. 

---

##  2.) State the elements of the CSS Box Model ?

---

##  2.) State the elements of the CSS Box Model ?

+ CSS Box Model consist of 4 elements 

+ Content - Displays the main content and the text of the web page.
+ Padding - This area encircles the content.
+ Border - The border is the padding's outer layer.
+ Margin - Margin is the area outside the border.

---


## 3.) Difference between ordered and unordered lists ?

---

## 3.) Difference between ordered and unordered lists ?

+ An unordered list uses <ul> </ul> tags and each element of the list is written between <li> </li> tags.
+ An ordered list uses <ol> </ol> tags and each element of the list is written between <li> </li> tags.

---
## 4.) What are the various Data Types in JavaScript?
---

## 4.) What are the various Data Types in JavaScript?

+ JavaScript has many data types to provide the basic functionality needed for a web application. 
+ They are mentioned in this table.

    + Boolean - For true or false values.
    + Null - For empty or unknown values.
    + Undefined - For variables that are only declared and not defined or initialized.
    + Number - For integer, floating-point values.
    + String - For characters and alphanumeric values.
    + Object - For collections or complex values, key-value pairs.
    + Symbols - For unique identifiers or objects.
---

## 5.) What is an higher order function ?

---

## 5.) What is an higher order function ?

+ A function which takes function as an argument or return function is called Higher Order Function.

+ Eg: setTimeout(), function is an higher-order function.

---

## 6.) What is a callback function ?

---

## 6.) What is a callback function ?

+ The function passed as an argument is called callback function.

+ Eg: The function passed inside the setTimeout() function to be called after a time.

---

## 7.)  What’s the difference between Function Declaration and Function Expression?

---

## 7.)  What’s the difference between Function Declaration and Function Expression?

+ Function Declaration 
+ 
    function abc(){
        return 5;
    }

+ Within the main JavaScript code, it declares this as a separate statement. 
  It is possible to invoke it before the function has been defined. It provides improved code readability.

+    Function Expression 
+    var a = function abc(){
        return
    }

+ It is created inside an expression or some other construct.
  It is generally used when there is a need for a conditional declaration of a function.

---

## 8.)  What are Closures in JavaScript?

---

## 8.)  What are Closures in JavaScript?

+ Closures in JavaScript are a feature where an inner function has access to the 
  outer function’s variables.
+ This is possible because the inner function retains a reference to the variables in the outer function,
   which are kept alive in memory.
+ function outer_func(){
    var b =10;
    function inner_func(){
        var a =20;
        console.log(a+b);
    }
    return inner;
    }

+ A closure has three scope chains –
    + Has access to the variable defined within its curly braces, which is its scope.
    + Has access to the outer functions' variables.
    + Has the ability to access global variables.

## 9.) Difference between div and span tags ?

---

## 9.) Difference between div and span tags ?

### DIV

+ It is utilized for separating the elements that are block-line, line break before and after it.

+ It contains global attributes for the certain element in HTML documents.

+ At times para tag <P> is utilised for inner side of the <div> tag.

+ In div tag, we make use of borders with width height with specified color pixels 
  to emphasize the front end document.

### SPAN

+ Span is utilized for grouping inline elements in the HTML doc.

+ It includes certain, global and event attributes.

+ In a paragraph, <span> tag is utilized to use a CSS style for certain words 
  with the selected font sets.

+ In the Span tag, we utilize specified color coding to depict the front-end document. 

---

## 10.) What is stringify?

---

## 10.) What is stringify?

+ IN a JSON method, stringify is used to transform a JavaScript object into a string. 
  JSON is a common structure to receive and send data between the web server and the client, and when we wish to send data to the webserver, the object ought to be a string.

+ Eg : var data = {ID:1, First_Name:'will', Second_name:'smith'};
       var send_data = JSON.stringify(data);
---
## 11.) Which method is used to retrieve a character from a certain index?
---

## 11.) Which method is used to retrieve a character from a certain index?

+ The charAt() method returns the character at a specified index (position) in a string.

+ Eg: console.log("Good Evening".charAt(7));

---

## 12.) Explain Hoisting in javascript ?

---

## 12.) Explain Hoisting in javascript ?

+ Hoisting in JavaScript is the behavior by which the declaration of 
  variables and functions are moved to the top. 
+ This means that the variable or function declaration need not be done 
  before initializing and calling them. 
+  Hoisting will happen only if var is used for declaration and not with 
   const or let declarations.

+ ```Eg 1:-
    hoistedVariable = 3;
    console.log(hoistedVariable); 
    // outputs 3 even when the variable is declared after it is initialized	
    var hoistedVariable;
  ``` 
+ 
      ```Eg 2:-
            hoistedFunction();  
            // Outputs " Hello world! " even when the function is declared after calling
            function hoistedFunction(){ 
            console.log(" Hello world! ");
            } 
    ```

+ Note - Variable initializations are not hoisted, only variable declarations are hoisted:
    ```
        var x;
        console.log(x); 
        // Outputs "undefined" since the initialization of "x" is not hoisted
        x = 23;
    ```

---

## 13.) Explain Type Coercion in javascript ?

---

## 13.) Explain Type Coercion in javascript ?

+ Type coercion is the automatic or implicit conversion of values from one data type 
  to another (such as strings to numbers).

+ Eg: 
    const value1 = "5";
    const value2 = 9;
    let sum = value1 + value2;

    console.log(sum);

+ In the above example, JavaScript has coerced the 9 from a number into a string and then concatenated the two values together, resulting in a string of 59. JavaScript had a choice between a string or a number and decided to use a string.

---

## 14.) Is javascript a statically typed or a dynamically typed language ?

---

## 14.) Is javascript a statically typed or a dynamically typed language ?

+ JavaScript is a dynamically-typed language where the interpreter assigns variables 
  a type at runtime based on the variable's value at the time.

+ JavaScript is a dynamically typed language, which means that data types of variables 
  are determined by the value they hold at runtime and can change throughout the program as we assign different values to them.

---

## 15.) What is NaN property in JavaScript ?

---

## 15.) What is NaN property in JavaScript ?

+ The JavaScript isNaN() Function is used to check whether a given value is an 
  illegal number or not. 
  It indicates a value that is not a legal number.
  It returns true if the value is a NaN else returns false. 
  It is different from the Number, but typeof of NaN will return a Number.

+ Eg: 
    function sanitise(x) {
        if (isNaN(x)) {
            return NaN;
            }
            return x;
            }

    console.log(sanitise('NotANumber'));
    // Expected output: NaN

## 16.) Explain passed by value and passed by reference ?

---

## 16.) Explain passed by value and passed by reference ?

## Pass By Value

+ In Pass by value, function is called by directly passing the value of the variable as 
  an argument. 
+ So any changes made inside the function does not affect the original value.

+ In Pass by value, parameters passed as an arguments create its own copy. 
  So any changes made inside the function is made to the copied value not to 
  the original value .

+ 
```Eg:
        
function Passbyvalue(a, b) {
    let tmp;
    tmp = b;
    b = a;
    a = tmp;
    console.log(`Inside Pass by value
        function -> a = ${a} b = ${b}`);
    }
 
    let a = 1;
    let b = 2;
    console.log(`Before calling Pass by value
            Function -> a = ${a} b = ${b}`);
    
    Passbyvalue(a, b);
    
    console.log(`After calling Pass by value
        Function -> a =${a} b = ${b}`);
```

## Pass By Reference

+ In Pass by Reference, Function is called by directly passing the reference/address 
  of the variable as an argument. 
+ So changing the value inside the function also change the original value. 
  In JavaScript array and Object follows pass by reference property.

+ In Pass by reference, parameters passed as an arguments does not create its own copy, 
  it refers to the original value so changes made inside function affect the original value.

```Eg:
    
    function PassbyReference(obj) {
    let tmp = obj.a;
    obj.a = obj.b;
    obj.b = tmp;
 
    console.log(`Inside Pass By Reference
        Function -> a = ${obj.a} b = ${obj.b}`);
    }
 
    let obj = {
    a: 10,
    b: 20
 
    }
    
    console.log(`Before calling Pass By Reference
    Function -> a = ${obj.a} b = ${obj.b}`);
 
    PassbyReference(obj)
 
    console.log(`After calling Pass By Reference
    Function -> a = ${obj.a} b = ${obj.b}`);
```

## 17.) What do you mean by Self Invoking Functions ?

---

## 17.) What do you mean by Self Invoking Functions ?

+ Self-invoking expression is invoked (started) automatically, without being called.
  Function expressions will execute automatically if the expression is followed by (). 
  You cannot self-invoke a function declaration.

+ A self-invoking (also called self-executing) function is a nameless (anonymous) function that is invoked immediately after its definition. 
  An anonymous function is enclosed inside a set of parentheses followed by another set of parentheses () , which does the execution.

+
    ```Eg: 
    (function () {
        let x = "Hello!!";  // I will invoke myself
   })();
    ```

+ The function above is actually an anonymous self-invoking function.
  (function without name).

## 18.) Explain “this” keyword ?

---

## 18.) Explain “this” keyword ?

+ “This” keyword refers to an object that is executing the current piece of code. 
  It references the object that is executing the current function. 

+ 
```Eg:-
    const person = {
        firstName: "John",
        lastName : "Doe",
        id       : 5566,
        fullName : function() {
        return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;
        }
    };

    here, this.firstName is the firstName property of this (the person object).
```

## 19.) Explain call(), apply() and bind() methods ?

---

## 19.) Explain call(), apply() and bind() methods ?

+ The call, bind and apply methods can be used to set the this keyword independent 
  of how a function is called. 
+ The bind method creates a copy of the function and sets the this keyword, 
  while the call and apply methods sets the this keyword and calls the function immediately.

### Call

+ The call() method is a predefined JavaScript method.
+ It can be used to invoke (call) a method with an owner object as an argument (parameter).
+ With call(), an object can use a method belonging to another object.
+ The call method binds the this value to the function and executes the function. 
+ It takes the this value and a list of arguments as parameters. 
+ Then, it returns the value returned by the function, which is called using 
   the call method.
+ call() method allows an object to use the method (function) of another object.
+ This method invokes a method (function) by specifying the owner object.
+ This example calls the fullName method of person, using it on person1:
+ 
```Eg This example calls the fullName method of person, using it on person1:
        const person = {
        fullName: function() {
            return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;
        }
        }
        const person1 = {
        firstName:"John",
        lastName: "Doe"
        }
        const person2 = {
        firstName:"Mary",
        lastName: "Doe"
        }

        // This will return "John Doe":
        person.fullName.call(person1);
```

``` Eg: The call() method can accept arguments:
    const person = {
    fullName: function(city, country) {
        return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName + "," + city + "," + country;
    }
    }

    const person1 = {
    firstName:"John",
    lastName: "Doe"
    }

    person.fullName.call(person1, "Oslo", "Norway");
```
### Apply

+ The apply() method takes arguments as an array.
+ The apply method binds the this value to the function and executes the function. 
+ It takes the this value and a single array object as parameters, and 
  it returns the value returned by the function, which is called using the apply method.
+ call() method takes arguments separately whereas, apply() method takes arguments as an array.
+ 
```Eg
    const person = {
    fullName: function(city, country) {
        return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName + "," + city + "," + country;
    }
    }

    const person1 = {
    firstName:"John",
    lastName: "Doe"
    }

    person.fullName.apply(person1, ["Oslo", "Norway"]);
```
### Bind    

+ the bind() method, an object can borrow a method from another object.
+ The member object borrows the fullname method from the person object:
+ The bind method binds the this value to the function and returns a new function.
+ However, we still need to separately invoke the returned function.
+ This method returns a new function, where the value of “this” keyword will be bound 
  to the owner object, which is provided as a parameter.
+ 
``` Eg:
    const person = {
    firstName:"John",
    lastName: "Doe",
    fullName: function () {
        return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;
    }
    }

    const member = {
    firstName:"Hege",
    lastName: "Nilsen",
    }

    let fullName = person.fullName.bind(member);
```

## 20.) Mention some advantages and disadvantages of javascript ?

### Advantages of JavaScript
+ Firstly, we will discuss the benefits or advantages of using JavaScript –

+ 1. Speed
    + Since JavaScript is an ‘interpreted’ language, it reduces the time required by other programming languages like Java for compilation. 
    + JavaScript is also a client-side script, speeding up the execution of the program as it saves the time required to connect to the server.

+ 2. Simplicity
    + JavaScript is easy to understand and learn. 
    + The structure is simple for the users as well as the developers. 
    + It is also very feasible to implement, saving developers a lot of money 
      for developing dynamic content for the web.

+ 3. Popularity
    + Since all modern browsers support JavaScript, it is seen almost everywhere. 
    + All the famous companies use JavaScript as a tool including Google, Amazon, PayPal, etc.

+ 4. Interoperability
    + JavaScript works perfect with other programming languages and therefore numerous developers prefer it in developing many applications. 
    + We can embed it into any webpage or inside the script of another programming language.

+ 5. Server Load
    + As JavaScript operates on the client-side, data validation is possible on the browser itself rather than sending it off to the server. 
    + In case of any discrepancy, the whole website needs not to be reloaded. 
    + The browser updates only the selected segment of the page.

+ 6. Rich Interfaces
    + JavaScript provides various interfaces to developers for creating catchy webpages. 
    + Drag and drop components or sliders may give a rich interface to the webpages. 
    + This leads to improved user-interactivity on the webpage.

+ 7. Extended Functionality
    + Third-party add-ons like Greasemonkey (a Mozilla Firefox extension) allow the 
    developers to add snippets of predefined code in their code to save time and money.
    + These add-ons help the developers build JavaScript applications a lot faster and 
    with much more ease than other programming languages.

+ 8. Versatility
    + JavaScript is now capable of front-end as well as back-end development.
    + Back-end development uses NodeJS while many libraries help in front-end development like AngularJS, ReactJS, etc.

+ 9. Less Overhead
    + JavaScript improves the performance of websites and web applications by 
    reducing the code length. 
    + The codes contain less overhead with the use of various 
    built-in functions for loops,    DOM access, etc.

### Disadvantages of JavaScript

+ 1. Client-side Security
    + Since the JavaScript code is viewable to the user, others may use it 
    for malicious purposes.
    + These practices may include using the source code without authentication. 
    + Also, it is very easy to place some code into the site that compromises the security 
    of data over the website.

+ 2. Browser Support
    + The browser interprets JavaScript differently in different browsers. 
    + Thus, the code must be run on various platforms before publishing.
    + The older browsers don’t support some new functions and we need to check them as well.

+ 3. Lack of Debugging Facility
    + Though some HTML editors support debugging, it is not as efficient as other 
    editors like C/C++ editors. 
    + Also, as the browser doesn’t show any error, it is difficult for the developer 
    to detect the problem.

+ 4. Single Inheritance
    + JavaScript only supports single inheritance and not multiple inheritance. 
    + Some programs may require this object-oriented language characteristic.

+ 5. Rendering Stopped
    + A single code error can stop the rendering of the entire JavaScript code on the website.
    + To the user, it looks as if JavaScript was not present. 
    + However, the browsers are extremely tolerant of these errors.

## 21.) What are the types of errors in javascript ?

+ Runtime errors: 
    + These occur during the execution of a program and can cause it to crash or behave unexpectedly. 
    + Runtime errors are usually caused by invalid data or unexpected conditions, such as dividing 
      a number by zero or trying to access a non-existent object property.
+ Logical errors: 
    + These occur when a program runs without crashing but produces incorrect or unexpected results.
    + Logical errors are usually caused by errors in the program's algorithm or logic, such as 
      using the wrong formula for a calculation or not handling a specific condition.
+ ReferenceError: "x" is not defined

## 22.) What is currying ?

+ Currying in JavaScript transforms a function with multiple arguments 
  into a nested series of functions, each taking a single argument. 
+ Currying helps you avoid passing the same variable multiple times, and 
  it helps you create a higher order function.
+ Eg: Function with full of arguments.
    ```
        function sum(a, b, c) {
            return a + b + c;
        }
        sum(1,2,3); 

        Let’s create a curried version of the function

        function sum(a) {
            return (b) => {
                return (c) => {
                    return a + b + c
                }
            }
        }
        console.log(sum(1)(2)(3)) // 6
    ```

## 23.) What is scope and Scope Chain in javascript ?

---

## 23.) What is scope and Scope Chain in javascript ?

+ Scope determines the accessibility of variables, objects, and functions 
  from different parts of the code.

+ **Block Scope :**
    + Variables declared using (let, const) these two keywords provide Block Scope 
      in JavaScript.
    + Variables declared inside a { } block cannot be accessed from outside the block:
    + ```Eg
            {
        let x = 2;
        }
        // x can NOT be used here
        // var keyword cannot have block scope.
        ```

+ **Local Scope :**
    + Variables declared within a JavaScript function, become LOCAL to the function.
    + Since local variables are only recognized inside their functions, variables 
      with the same name can be used in different functions.
    + Local variables are created when a function starts, and deleted when the function 
      is completed.
    + ```Eg
            // code here can NOT use carName

            function myFunction() {
                let carName = "Volvo";
            // code here CAN use carName
            }

            // code here can NOT use carName
    ```

+ **Function Scope :**
    + JavaScript has function scope: Each function creates a new scope.
    + Variables defined inside a function are not accessible (visible) from outside 
      the function.
    + Variables declared with var, let and const are quite similar when declared 
      inside a function.
    +```Eg: They all have Function Scope:
        function myFunction() {
            var carName = "Volvo";   // Function Scope
            let bikeName = "RE";
            const cycleName = "ladyBird";
        }
    ``` 

+ **Global Scope :**
    + Variables declared Globally (outside any function) have Global Scope.
    + Global variables can be accessed from anywhere in a JavaScript program.
    + Variables declared with var, let and const are quite similar when declared outside 
      a block.
    + ``` Eg: -They all have Global Scope:
        var x = 2;       // Global scope
        let y = 2;       // Global scope
        const z = 2;       // Global scope
    ```
+ **Scope Chain:** 
    + JavaScript engine also uses Scope to find variables. Let’s understand that using an 
    + ```example:
    var y = 24;

    function favFunction(){
    var x = 667;
    var anotherFavFunction = function(){
        console.log(x); // Does not find x inside anotherFavFunction, so looks for variable inside favFunction, outputs 667
    }

    var yetAnotherFavFunction = function(){
        console.log(y); // Does not find y inside yetAnotherFavFunction, so looks for variable inside favFunction and does not find it, so looks for variable in global scope, finds it and outputs 24
    }

    anotherFavFunction();
    yetAnotherFavFunction();
    }
    favFunction();
    ```

## 24.) What is lexical scope in javascript ?

+ Lexical scope is the definition area of an expression.
+ In other words, an item's lexical scope is the place in which the item got created.
+ Note:
    + Another name for lexical scope is static scope.
    + The place an item got invoked (or called) is not necessarily the item's 
       lexical scope.
    + Instead, an item's definition space is its lexical scope.

+ ```Eg     
            function foo(a) {
                var b = a * 2;
                function bar(c) {
                    console.log( a, b, c );
                    }
                    bar(b * 3);
                    }
                    
                    foo( 2 ); // 2 4 12
                    ```

+ Lexical scope is write-time, whereas dynamic scope is run-time. 
  Lexical scope care where a function was declared, but dynamic scope cares where a function was called from.

## 25.) Difference between “ == “ and “ === “ operators ?

+ Both are comparison operators. 
+ The difference between both the operators is that “==” is used to compare 
  values whereas, “ === “ is used to compare both values and types.


``` Eg:- 
var x = 2;
var y = "2";
(x == y)  // Returns true since the value of both x and y is the same
(x === y) // Returns false since the typeof x is "number" and typeof y is "string"
```

## 26.) Difference between var, let and const keyword in javascript ?

### var

+ var has the function and global scope.
+ It gets hoisted to the top of its scope and initialized undefined.
+ It can be updated or re-declared.
+ It's an old way to declare a variable.

### let

+ let's have the block scope.
+ It also got hoisted to the top of its scope but didn't initialize.
+ It can only be updated and can't be re-declared.
+ It's a new way to declare variables introduced in ES6.

### const

+ const variable has the block scope.
+ It also got hoisted to the top of its scope but didn't initialize.
+ It can't be updated or re-declared.

## 27.) What is the difference between exec () and test () methods in javascript ?

+ test () and exec () are RegExp expression methods used in javascript. 
+ We'll use exec () to search a string for a specific pattern, and if it finds it, 
  it'll return the pattern directly; else, it'll return an 'empty' result.
+ We will use a test () to find a string for a specific pattern. 
  It will return the Boolean value 'true' on finding the given text otherwise, it will return 'false'.

## 28.) What is memoization ?

---

## 28.) What is memoization ?

+ Memoization is a form of caching where the return value of a function is cached based on its parameters. 
+ If the parameter of that function is not changed, the cached version of the function is returned.
+ Let’s understand memoization, by converting a simple function to a memoized function:

+ Note- Memoization is used for expensive function calls but in the following example, we are considering a simple function for understanding the concept of memoization better.

+ Consider the following function:
    ```
        function addTo256(num){
        return num + 256;
        }
        addTo256(20); // Returns 276
        addTo256(40); // Returns 296
        addTo256(20); // Returns 276
    ```

+  {
    In the code above, we have written a function that adds the parameter to 256 and returns it.

    When we are calling the function addTo256 again with the same parameter (“20” in the case above), we are computing the result again for the same parameter.

    Computing the result with the same parameter, again and again, is not a big deal in the above case, but imagine if the function does some heavy-duty work, then, computing the result again and again with the same parameter will lead to wastage of time.

    This is where memoization comes in, by using memoization we can store(cache) the computed results based on the parameters. If the same parameter is used again while invoking the function, instead of computing the result, we directly return the stored (cached) value.

    Let’s convert the above function addTo256, to a memoized function:
    }

+ The memoized function of the above one would be:
    ```
            function memoizedAddTo256(){
        var cache = {};

        return function(num){
            if(num in cache){
            console.log("cached value");
            return cache[num]
            }
            else{
            cache[num] = num + 256;
            return cache[num];
            }
        }
        }
        var memoizedFunc = memoizedAddTo256();

        memoizedFunc(20); // Normal return
        memoizedFunc(20); // Cached return
    ```

+ In the code above, if we run the memoizedFunc function with the same parameter, instead of computing the result again, it returns the cached result.

+ Note- Although using memoization saves time, it results in larger consumption of memory since we are storing all the computed results.

## 29.) What is recursion in a programming language ?

+ Recursion is a technique to iterate over an operation by having a function call 
  itself repeatedly until it arrives at a result.

+ ```Eg:-
    function add(number) {
    if (number <= 0) {
        return 0;
    } else {
        return number + add(number - 1);
    }
        }
        add(3) => 3 + add(2)
                3 + 2 + add(1)
                3 + 2 + 1 + add(0)
                3 + 2 + 1 + 0 = 6 
    ```

## 30.) What are arrow functions ?

---

## 30.) What are arrow functions ?

+ Arrow functions were introduced in the ES6 version of javascript.  
+  They provide us with a new and shorter syntax for declaring functions. 
+  Arrow functions can only be used as a function expression.

+ ```
  // Traditional Function Expression
  var add = function(a,b){
    return a + b;
  }

  // Arrow Function Expression
  var arrowAdd = (a,b) => a + b;
  ```

+ Arrow functions are declared without the function keyword. 
+ If there is only one returning expression then we don’t need to use the return keyword as well in 
  an arrow function as shown in the example above. 
+ Also, for functions having just one line of code, curly braces { } can be omitted.

+ ```
  // Traditional function expression
  var multiplyBy2 = function(num){
    return num * 2;
  }
  // Arrow function expression
  var arrowMultiplyBy2 = num => num * 2;
  ```

+ If the function takes in only one argument, then the parenthesis () around the parameter can be omitted 
  as shown in the code above. 

+ ```
    var obj1 = {
    valueOfThis: function(){
      return this;
    }
  }
  var obj2 = {
    valueOfThis: ()=>{
      return this;
    }
  }

  obj1.valueOfThis(); // Will return the object obj1
  obj2.valueOfThis(); // Will return window/global object 
  ```

+ The biggest difference between the traditional function expression and the arrow function is the handling 
  of this keyword. 
+ By general definition, this keyword always refers to the object that is calling the function. 
+ As you can see in the code above, obj1.valueOfThis() returns obj1 since this keyword refers to the 
  object calling the function.

+ In the arrow functions, there is no binding of this keyword. 
+ This keyword inside an arrow function does not refer to the object calling it. 
+ It rather inherits its value from the parent scope which is the window object in this case. 
+ Therefore, in the code above, obj2.valueOfThis() returns the window object.

## 31.) What is the difference between "undefined" and "null" in JavaScript ?

---

## 31.) What is the difference between "undefined" and "null" in JavaScript ?

### undefined :

+ Undefined means the variable has been declared, but its value has not been assigned.
+ The typeof() operator returns undefined for an undefined variable.
+ It returns NaN on performing arithmetic operations.
+ As there is no value assigned to the variable, it becomes undefined.

### null :

+ Null means an empty value or a blank value.
+ The typeof() operator returns the type as an object for a variable whose value is assigned as null.
+ converts to 0 then perform the operation.
+ As we assign null to a variable, it is an assignment value.

#### null is a value that represents the intentional absence of any object value. It is often used to indicate that a variable has no value assigned to it. undefined, on the other hand, is a value that represents an uninitialized variable or a missing property in an object.

#### "Undefined" is a value that is automatically assigned to a variable that has been declared but not yet assigned a value, Whereas "null" is a value that is explicitly assigned to a variable to indicate that it has no value.

---

## 32.) What is the purpose of the "forEach" and "forin" method in JavaScript ?

### forIn - 

+ The "forIn" is used to iterate over the enumerable properties of objects. 

+ Every property in an object will have an Enumerable value — if that value is set to true, 
  then the property is Enumerable. 

+ ```Syntax :
  for (variable in object) {  
  // do something
  }
  ```
+ ```Eg :
    const obj = {  
    a: 1,
    b: 2,
    c: 3,
    d: 4
  }

  for (let element in obj ) {
    console.log(`${element} = ${obj[element]}`);
  }
  ```

### forEach - 

+ forEach is an Array method that we can use to execute a function on each element in an array. 
  It can only be used on Arrays.

+ The "forEach" method is used to execute a function once for each element in an array, 
  without changing the array itself.

+ ```Eg :
      const arr = ['skptricks', 'php', 'android'];
      arr.forEach(element => {
        console.log(element);
      });
  ```
#### The two main similarities between JavaScript forEach and for-in are both have for in their names: 
#### forEach and for in. Also, they can manipulate an array's element.
#### The primary difference between the forEach() method and for-in is that 
#### forEach() is a higher-order function, whereas for-in is a loop primarily meant to manipulate enumerables.
#### Besides, a for-in loop can handle other objects apart from arrays, whereas forEach() is an array method.

## 33.)  What is the difference between "setTimeout" and "setInterval" in JavaScript ?

+ "setTimeout" is used to execute a function once, after a specified number of milliseconds, 
  while "setInterval" is used to execute a function repeatedly, at a specified interval.

+ ```Eg : setTimeout()

    setTimeout(() => {
    console.log('Hello World!');
  }, 1000);
  ```

+ ```Eg : setInterval()

  let i = 0;
  function increment() {

## 41.) What are all the types of Pop up boxes available in JavaScript ?

+  Alert, Confirm and Prompt.

+ An alert box is often used if you want to make
  sure information comes through to the user.

  When an alert box pops up, the user will have
  to click "OK" to proceed.

+ A confirm box is often used if you want the
  user to verify or accept something.

  When a confirm box pops up, the user will have
  to click either "OK" or "Cancel" to proceed.

  If the user clicks "OK", the box returns true. If the user clicks "Cancel", the box returns false.

+ A prompt box is often used if you want the
  user to input a value before entering a page.

  When a prompt box pops up, the user will have to click either "OK" or "Cancel" to proceed after entering an input value.

  If the user clicks "OK" the box returns the input value. If the user clicks "Cancel" the box returns null.


+ ```
      // alert

      alert("I am an alert box!");

      // confirm

      if (confirm("Press the button!")) {
        txt = "You ACCEPTED !";
      } else {
        txt = "You CANCELLED !";
      }

## 42.) What is the difference between a synchronous and an asynchronous function in JavaScript ?

---

## 42.) What is the difference between a synchronous and an asynchronous function in JavaScript ?

### Synchronous Function

+ Instruction in synchronous code executes in a given sequence.
+ A synchronous function blocks the execution of the program until it has finished executing, 
  while an asynchronous function allows the program to continue executing while it performs an operation in the background.
+ That just means that only one operation can be in progress at a time.
+ JavaScript is synchronous by default and is single threaded. This means that code cannot create new 
  threads and run in parallel.
+ All functions are by default synchronous.

### Asynchronous Function

+ Instructions in asynchronous code can execute in parallel.
+ Asynchronous code execution allows to execution next instructions immediately and doesn't block the 
  flow because of previous instructions.
+ Next operation can occur while the previous operation is still getting processed.
+ Asynchronous functions often use callbacks or promises to handle the result of the operation.
+ Examples, 
  + The built-in functions such as setTimeout, setInterval, clearInterval.
  + User-defined functions with keyword, "async" before the function keyword, and "await" to handle 
    the promises in that async function.
  + ```Eg:-
          async function logger() {
      let data = await fetch("http://someapi.com/users"); // pause until fetch returns
      console.log(data);
      }
    logger();
    ```

#### Synchronous programming is when tasks are executed sequentially, one after the other, in a predictable order.Asynchronous programming is when tasks are executed concurrently, and the order of execution is not guaranteed.

## 43.) What is  promises in javascript?

---

## 43.) What is  promises in javascript?

+ A promise is a JavaScript object that represents a value that may not be available yet but 
  will be resolved in the future.
+ Promises are used to handle asynchronous operations in javascript.
+ Before promises, callbacks were used to handle asynchronous operations. 
+ But due to the limited functionality of callbacks, using multiple callbacks to handle asynchronous code 
  can lead to unmanageable code.

+ Promise object has four states -

    + Pending - Initial state of promise. This state represents that the promise has neither been 
                fulfilled nor been rejected, it is in the pending state.
    + Fulfilled - This state represents that the promise has been fulfilled, meaning the async operation 
                  is completed.
    + Rejected - This state represents that the promise has been rejected for some reason, 
                meaning the async operation has failed.
    + Settled - This state represents that the promise has been either rejected or fulfilled.

+ A promise is created using the Promise constructor which takes in a callback function with 
  two parameters, resolve and reject respectively.

    + resolve is a function that will be called when the async operation has been successfully completed.
    + reject is a function that will be called, when the async operation fails or if some error occurs.

+ then() method is used to access the result when the promise is fulfilled.

+ catch() method is used to access the result/error when the promise is rejected. 
  In the code below, we are consuming the promise:

+ ```Eg:-
      function sumOfThreeElements(...elements){
      return new Promise((resolve,reject)=>{
        if(elements.length > 3 ){
          reject("Only three elements or less are allowed");
        }
        else{
          let sum = 0;
          let i = 0;
          while(i < elements.length){
            sum += elements[i];
            i++;
          }
          resolve("Sum has been calculated: "+sum);
        }
      })
    }


    sumOfThreeElements(4, 5, 6)
    .then(result=> console.log(result))
    .catch(error=> console.log(error));
    // In the code above, the promise is fulfilled so the then() method gets executed
  ```

+ A callback function is a method that is sent as an input to another function (now let us name this other function "thisFunction"), and 
  it is performed inside the thisFunction after the function has completed execution.

+ JavaScript is a scripting language that is based on events. 
  Instead of waiting for a reply before continuing, JavaScript will continue to run while monitoring for additional events. 
  Callbacks are a technique of ensuring that a particular code does not run until another code has completed its execution.

## 45.) What is Destructuring ?

+ Destructuring is a new way to extract elements from an object or an array.

+ ```Eg:- Using Object

      const classDetails = {
      strength: 78,
      benches: 39,
      blackBoard:1
    }

    const {strength:classStrength, benches:classBenches,blackBoard:classBlackBoard} = classDetails;

    console.log(classStrength); // Outputs 78
    console.log(classBenches); // Outputs 39
    console.log(classBlackBoard); // Outputs 1
  ```

+ ```Eg:- Using Array

  const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4];
  const [first,second,third,fourth] = arr;
  console.log(first); // Outputs 1
  console.log(second); // Outputs 2
  console.log(third); // Outputs 3
  console.log(fourth); // Outputs 4

  ```

## 46.) What is async/await in JavaScript ?

+ Async/await is a way to write asynchronous code that looks like synchronous code. 
+ It allows developers to write code that waits for a promise to resolve before executing 
  the next line of code.

## 47.) What is event bubbling in JavaScript ?

---

## 47.) What is event bubbling in JavaScript ?

+ Event bubbling is the process by which an event propagates from the innermost element that triggered the event up to the document root, triggering all event handlers along the way.

+ Event bubbling is a way of event propagation in the HTML DOM API, when an event occurs in an element 
  inside another element, and both elements have registered a handle for that event. 
  With bubbling, the event is first captured and handled by the innermost element and then propagated to outer elements. 
  The execution starts from that event and goes to its parent element. 
  Then the execution passes to its parent element and so on till the body element.

## 48.) What is event delegation in JavaScript ?

+ Event delegation is a technique in which a single event handler is added to a parent element, rather than multiple event handlers being added to multiple child elements.

---

## 49.) What is a decorator in JavaScript ?

+ A decorator in JavaScript is a function that is used to modify the behavior of another function or object.
+ Decorators are typically used to add functionality to an existing function or object without modifying its original source code.

+ A decorator is an expression that evaluates to a function and that takes the target,
  name, and decorator descriptor as arguments. 
+ Also, it optionally returns a decorator descriptor to install on the target object.
+ Let us define admin decorator for user class at design time.

+ ```
      function admin(isAdmin) {
  return function(target) {
      target.isAdmin = isAdmin;
  }
  }

  @admin(true)
  class User() {
  }
  console.log(User.isAdmin); //true

  @admin(false)
  class User() {
  }
  console.log(User.isAdmin); //false
  ```

## 50.) What is the difference between onclick and addEventListener in JavaScript ?

---

## 50.) What is the difference between onclick and addEventListener in JavaScript ?

+ The main difference between onclick and addEventListener in JavaScript is how they handle multiple 
  event listeners for the same element.

+ onclick is an inline event handler attribute that can be added to an HTML element to execute a 
  JavaScript function when the element is clicked.
+ It can only handle a single function at a time, which means that if multiple onclick attributes are 
  added to the same element, only the last one will be executed.

+ Also, it cannot be removed once it is set.

+ On the other hand, addEventListener is a method that allows you to attach multiple event listeners 
  to an element.
+ It can handle multiple functions at the same time and the order in which they are added is preserved. 
+ Also, it allows you to remove a specific listener from the element using 
  the removeEventListener method.

## 51.) What is JSON and how is it used in JavaScript ?

---

## 51.) What is JSON and how is it used in JavaScript ?

+ JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data interchange format that is easy for humans 
  to read and write and easy for machines to parse and generate. 
+ It is a text format that is used to represent data in a structured way and is widely used for 
  data exchange between web servers and clients.
+ In JavaScript, JSON is used to exchange data between a web server and a web application. 
+ The JSON format is based on a subset of the JavaScript programming language and is 
  natively supported by most modern web browsers.

+ ```Eg:-
    const jsonStr1 = '{"name":"Sarah",
                      "age":"25",
                      "city":"Mumbai"}'
    const person1 = JSON.parse(jsonStr1);
    console.log(person1.name);
    console.log(person1.age);
    console.log(person1.city);

    const person2 = {name:"Sonny",
                    age:26,
                    city:"Pune"}
    const jsonStr2 = JSON.stringify(person2);
    console.log(jsonStr2);
  ```

## 52.) What is AJAX in JavaScript ?

---

## 52.) What is AJAX in JavaScript ?

+ AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) is a technique used in web development to exchange data with 
  a web server asynchronously, without the need to reload the entire page. 
+ It allows web applications to update parts of a web page without refreshing the entire page, 
  providing a smoother and more responsive user experience.
+ In JavaScript, AJAX is typically implemented using the XMLHttpRequest (XHR) object, which allows you to 
  send HTTP requests to a server and receive responses in different formats,
  such as HTML, XML, JSON, or plain text.
+ Here's an example of how to use the XHR object to send an HTTP
+ GET request to a web server and receive a JSON response:
+ ```Eg:-

  const xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
  xhr.open('GET', 'https://api.example.com/data.json', true);

  xhr.onload = function(){
    if(this.status === 200){
      const data = JSON.parse(this.responseText);
      console.log(data);
    }else{
      console.log('Error: ' + this.statusText);
    }
  };

  xhr.onerror = function(){
    console.log('Error: '+ this.statusText);
  };

  xhr.send();

  ```

## 53.) What is try-catch in JavaScript ?

+ try-catch is a JavaScript statement that allows you to handle exceptions that occur 
  during the execution of a program. 
+ The try block contains the code that might throw an exception, while the catch block handles 
  the exception by executing a set of statements.
+ ```Eg:-
      try{
        //block of code that might throw an exception.
      }catch(error){
        // block of code to handle the exception.
      }

## 54.) What is the event loop in JavaScript ?

+ The event loop is a mechanism in JavaScript that allows for asynchronous programming. 
+ It continuously monitors the call stack and the message queue, and when the call stack is empty, 
  it takes the first message from the queue and adds it to the call stack.

## 55.) How do you create a class in javascript ?

---

## 55.) How do you create a class in javascript ?

+ JavaScript Classes was introduced in ES6.
+ JavaScript Classes are templates for JavaScript Objects.
  (A JavaScript class is not an object.It is a template for JavaScript objects.)
+ Use the keyword class to create a class.
+ The constructor method is called automatically when a new object is created.

  #### The Constructor Method

  + The constructor method is a special method:
  + It has to have the exact name "constructor"
  + It is executed automatically when a new object is created
  + It is used to initialize object properties
  + If you do not define a constructor method, JavaScript will add an empty constructor method. 

  + ```Eg:-
      class Student {
      constructor(name, year) {
        this.name = name;
        this.year = year;
      }
      age(x) {
        return x - this.year;
      }
    }

    let date = new Date();
    let year = date.getFullYear();

    let myStudent = new Student("Soju", 2014);
    console.log("Student " + myStudent.name + " is " + myStudent.age(year) + " years old.");
    ```

## 56.) What is DOCTYPE in HTML ?

+ All HTML documents must start with a <!DOCTYPE> declaration. 
+ This declaration is not an HTML tag but it acts like the information provided 
  to the web browser on what type of elements and attribute to expect in a HTML document.
+ DOCTYPE html tag defines the TYPE of document as HTML. 
  After the browser understands the TYPE of document is HTML, we may now define the HTML document itself by the code we create between the html/html tags.
  -a web-document consisting of HTML pages. -an HTML page consisting of a header, body, and footer.
+ The DOCTYPE is declared before the head section in a HTML document.
+ DOCTYPE is an abbreviation for “document type”. 
  It is a declaration used in HTML to distinguish between standards mode and quirks mode. Its presence tells the browser to render the web page in standards mode.

## 57.) When to use css grid and flexbox ?

+ CSS Grid Layout is a two-dimensional system, meaning it can handle both 
  columns and rows, unlike flexbox which is largely a one-dimensional system 
  (either in a column or a row).
+ A core difference between CSS Grid and Flexbox is that — CSS Grid’s 
  approach is layout-first while Flexbox’ approach is content-first. 
  If you are well aware of your content before making layout, then blindly opt for Flexbox and if not, opt for CSS Grid.
+ Flexbox layout is most appropriate to the components of an application 
  (as most of them are fundamentally linear), and small-scale layouts, 
  while the Grid layout is intended for larger-scale layouts which aren’t linear in their design.
+ If you only need to define a layout as a row or a column, then you probably 
  need flexbox. 
  If you want to define a grid and fit content into it in two dimensions — you need the grid.

+ ``` 1-Dimensional →
      2-Dimensional  ↓→
  ```

+ ```Eg:-
          <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
      <head>
        <title>Grid vs Flexbox Layout</title>
      </head>

## 58.) What is the purpose of the z-index and how a stacking context is formed ?

+ The z-index helps specify the stack order of positioned elements that may 
  overlap one another. 
  The z-index default value is zero, and can take on either a positive or negative number. 
  An element with a higher z-index is always stacked above than a lower index.

+ z-index can take the following values:

  + Auto: Sets the stack order equal to its parents.
  + Number: Orders the stack order.
  + Initial: Sets this property to its default value (0).
  + Inherit: Inherits this property from its parent element.

## 59.) Exaplain CSS position Property ?

---

## 59.) Exaplain CSS position Property ?

+ **absolute**, place an element exactly where you want to place it. 
  absolute position is actually set relative to the element's parent. 
  If no parent available then relatively place to the page itself (it will default all the way back up to the element).

+ **relative**, means "relative to itself". 
  Setting position: relative; on an element and no other positioning attributes, it will no effect on it's positioning. 
  It allows the use of z-index on the element and it limits the scope of absolutely positioned child elements.
  Any child element will be absolutely positioned within that block.

+ **fixed**, element is positioned relative to viewport or the browser 
  window itself.
  Viewport doesn't changed if you scroll and hence fixed element will stay right in the same position.

+ **static** default for every single page element.
  The only reason you would ever set an element to position: static is to forcefully-remove some positioning that got applied to an element outside of your control.

+ **sticky**- Sticky positioning is a hybrid of relative and fixed positioning.
  The element is treated as relative positioned until it crosses a specified threshold, at which point it is treated as fixed positioned.

## 60.) What is CSS flexbox ? Write all the properties of the flexbox ?

+ The Flexible Box Layout Module, makes it easier to design flexible responsive 
  layout structure without using float or positioning. 
  Flexbox makes it simple to align items vertically and horizontally using rows and columns. 
  Items will "flex" to different sizes to fill the space.

+ Before the Flexbox Layout module, there were four layout modes:

    + Block, for sections in a webpage
    + Inline, for text
    + Table, for two-dimensional table data
    + Positioned, for explicit position of an element

+ Flex Container:

  An area of a document laid out using flexbox is called a flex container. 
  To create a flex container, we set the value of the area's container's display property to flex or inline-flex. 
  As soon as we do this the direct children of that container become flex items.

## 61.)  Explain CSS grid layout with example ?

+ CSS Grid Layout excels at dividing a page into major regions or defining the relationship in terms of size, position, and layer, between parts of a control built from HTML primitives. 
  Like tables, grid layout enables us to align elements into columns and rows.

+ Basic Terminology:
  // Diagram of rows and columns. 

+ Grid Item: The grid container contains the grid items.
+ Grid Line: The grid line is either a vertical or horizontal grid line that makes up 
             the structure of the grid.
+ Grid Cell: The smallest unit on a grid is referred to as a Grid cell. 
             It is the space between the two adjacent rows and columns.
+ Rows: The grid row is the horizontal track of the grid.
+ Columns: The grid column is the vertical track of the grid.
+ Gutter: A gutter is a space between the rows and columns in the grid.

+ CSS Grid Properties :

  + Property	:                 Description
    + column-gap :	           Specifies the gap between the columns
    + gap	:          A shorthand property for the row-gap and the column-gap properties
    + grid :	A shorthand property for the grid-template-rows, grid-template-columns,
             grid-template-areas, grid-auto-rows, grid-auto-columns, and the grid-auto-flow properties
    + grid-area :	Either specifies a name for the grid item, or this property is a
                  shorthand property for the grid-row-start, grid-column-start, grid-row-end, and grid-column-end properties
    + grid-auto-columns :	Specifies a default column size
    + grid-auto-flow :	Specifies how auto-placed items are inserted in the grid
    + grid-auto-rows :	Specifies a default row size
    + grid-column	: A shorthand property for the grid-column-start and 
                    the grid-column-end properties
    + grid-column-end :	Specifies where to end the grid item
    + grid-column-gap	: Specifies the size of the gap between columns
    + grid-column-start :	Specifies where to start the grid item
    + grid-gap :	A shorthand property for the grid-row-gap and grid-column-gap properties
    + grid-row :	A shorthand property for the grid-row-start and the grid-row-end 
                  properties
    + grid-row-end :	Specifies where to end the grid item
    + grid-row-gap :	Specifies the size of the gap between rows
    + grid-row-start :	Specifies where to start the grid item
    + grid-template :	A shorthand property for the grid-template-rows,
                      grid-template-columns and grid-areas properties
    + grid-template-areas	: Specifies how to display columns and rows, using named grid
                            items
    + grid-template-columns :	Specifies the size of the columns, and how many columns in
                               a grid layout
    + grid-template-rows :	Specifies the size of the rows in a grid layout
    + row-gap : 	Specifies the gap between the grid rows

## 62.) What is the difference between Pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements ?

+ A pseudo-class is a selector that assists in the selection of something that cannot 
  be expressed by a simple selector, for example :hover. 
  A pseudo-element however allows us to create items that do not normally exist in the document tree, for example ::after.

### Pseudo-classes:

+ Pseudo-classes select regular elements but under certain conditions, like when their
  position relative to siblings or when they're under a particular state. 
  Here is a list of pseudo-classes in CSS3:

+  A pseudo-class is used to define a special state of an element.

  + For example, it can be used to:

    + Style an element when a user mouses over it
    + Style visited and unvisited links differently
    + Style an element when it gets focus

+ **a) Dynamic pseudo-classes:**

  + :link - Selects all unvisited links
  + :visited - Selects all visited links
  + :hover - Selects links on mouse over
  + :active - Selects the active link
  + :focus - Selects the <input> element that has focus

+ **b) UI element states pseudo-classes:**

  + :enabled - Selects every enabled element
  + :disabled - Selects every disabled element
  + :checked - Selects every checked element

+ **c) Structural pseudo-classes:**

  + :first-child - Selects every elements that is the first child of its parent
  + :nth-child(n) - Selects every element that is the nth child of its parent
  + :nth-last-child(n) - Selects every  element that is the nth child of its parent
  + :nth-of-type(n) - Selects every element that is the nth element of its parent
  + :nth-last-of-type(n) - Selects every element that is the nth element of its parent,
                           counting from the last child
  + :last-child - 	Selects every  elements that is the last child of its parent
  + :first-of-type - Selects every  element that is the first element of its parent
  + :last-of-type - Selects every element that is the last element of its parent
  + :only-child - 	Selects every element that is the only child of its parent
  + :only-of-type - Selects every element that is the only element of its parent
  + :root - Selects the document's root element
  + :empty - Selects every element that has no children

**d) Other pseudo-classes:**

  + :not(x)  - Selects every element that is not a given element
  + :target - Selects the current active element (clicked on a URL containing that anchor
              name)
  + :lang(language) - Selects every element with a lang attribute value starting with "it"

### Pseudo-elements:

+ Pseudo-elements effectively create new elements that are not specified in the markup of
  the document and can be manipulated much like a regular element.

+ A CSS pseudo-element is used to style specified parts of an element.

+ For example, it can be used to:

  + Style the first letter, or line, of an element
  + Insert content before, or after, the content of an element

+ CSS Pseudo Elements:
  + ::before - Insert something before the content of each element
  + ::after - Insert something after the content of each element
  + ::first-letter - Selects the first letter of each element
  + ::first-line - Selects the first line of each element
  + ::selection - Selects the portion of an element that is selected by a user

## 63.) How do you specify units in the CSS ?

## 63.) How do you specify units in the CSS ?

+ There are various units in CSS to express the measurement and length. 
+ A CSS unit is used to determine the property size, which we set for an element or its
  content.

+ The length unit in CSS is of two types:

    + Absolute length units.
    + Relative length units.

**Absolute length units:**

+ The following are all absolute length units — they are not relative to anything else,
  and are generally considered to always be the same size.

+ Unit →	Name →	Equivalent to
    +  cm	→ Centimeters	→ 1cm = 38px = 25/64in
    +  mm →	Millimeters →	1mm = 1/10th of 1cm
    +  Q →	Quarter-millimeters	→ 1Q = 1/40th of 1cm
    +  in	→ Inches →	1in = 2.54cm = 96px
    +  pc	→ Picas →	1pc = 1/6th of 1in
    +  pt →	Points →	1pt = 1/72th of 1in
    +  px →	Pixels →	1px = 1/96th of 1in

**Relative length units:**

+ Relative length units specify a length relative to another length property. 
  Relative length units scale better between different rendering medium.

+ Unit →	Relative to
    +  em	→ Font size of the parent, in the case of typographical properties like
            font-size, and font size of the element itself, in the case of other properties like width.
    +  ex	→ x-height of the element's font.
    +  ch	→ The advance measure (width) of the glyph "0" of the element's font.
    +  rem	→ Font size of the root element.
    +  lh	→ Line height of the element.
    +  vw	→ 1% of the viewport's width.
    +  vh	→ 1% of the viewport's height.
    +  vmin →	1% of the viewport's smaller dimension.
    +  vmax →	1% of the viewport's larger dimension.

## 64.)  Which one would you prefer among px, em % or pt and why ?

---

## 64.)  Which one would you prefer among px, em % or pt and why ?

+ px gives fine grained control and maintains alignment because 1 px or multiple of 1 px
  is guaranteed to look sharp. px is not cascade, 
  this means if parent font-size is 20px and child 16px. child would be 16px.

+ em maintains relative size. you can have responsive fonts. 
  em is the width of the letter 'm' in the selected typeface. 
  However, this concept is tricky.
  1em is equal to the current font-size of the element or the browser default. 
  If u sent font-size to 16px then 1em = 16px. 
  The common practice is to set default body font-size to 62.5% (equal to 10px). 
  em is cascade

+ % sets font-size relative to the font size of the body. 
  Hence, you have to set font-size of the body to a reasonable size. 
  This is easy to use and does cascade. for example, if parent font-size is 20px and child font-size is 50%. Child would be 10px.

+ pt(points) are traditionally used in print. 1pt = 1/72 inch and it is fixed-size unit.

## 65.) What are the possible ways to apply CSS styles to a web page ?

---

## 65.) What are the possible ways to apply CSS styles to a web page ?

+ There are three ways to apply CSS to HTML: Inline, internal, and external.

+ **1. Inline CSS:**

  + Inline CSS is specified directly in the opening tag of the element you want it to
    apply to. 
  + It is entered into the style attribute within HTML. This allows CSS properties on a
   "per tag" basis.
  + ``` 
      <p style="font-weight:bold;">Bold Font</p> 
    ```

+ **2. Internal CSS:**

    + Internal or Embedded, styles are used for the whole page. 
    + Inside the head element, the style tags surround all of the styles for the page.

    + ```
          <style>
              p {
                  color: red;
              }
              
              a {
                  color: blue;
              }
            </style>

      ```
  
+ **3. External CSS:**

  + In external CSS rules are stored in a separate file. 
  + To refer to that file from the HTML page, add the link element (and its closing element within XHTML) to the head element. 
  + This CSS type is a more efficient method, especially for styling a large website. 
  + By editing one .css file, you can change your entire site at once.
  +``` <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style.css"> ```

## 66.) What are the css selectors ?

---

## 66.) What are the css selectors ?

+ A CSS selector is the part of a CSS rule set that actually selects the content you want to style.

+ **i) Universal Selector :** 

  + The universal selector works like a wild card character, selecting all elements 
    on a page. 
  + Every HTML page is built on content placed within HTML tags. 
  + Each set of tags represents an element on the page.

  + ```
    * {
   color: green;
   font-size: 20px;
   line-height: 25px;
    }
    ```

+ **ii) Element Type Selector:**

  + This selector match one or more HTML elements of the same name.
  + ```
        ul {
        list-style: none;
        border: solid 1px #ccc;
      }
    ```

+ **iii) ID Selector:**

  + This selector matches any HTML element that has an ID attribute with the same value 
    as that of the selector.

  + ```
      #container {
        width: 960px;
        margin: 0 auto;
      }
    ```
+ **iv) Class Selector:**

  + The class selector also matches all elements on the page that have their class
     attribute set to the same value as the class.

  +```
    .box {
    padding: 20px;
    margin: 10px;
    width: 240px;
      }
  ```

+ **v) Descendant Combinator:**

  + The descendant selector or, more accurately, the descendant combinator lets you
    combine two or more selectors so you can be more specific in your selection method.

  + ```
  #container .box {
   float: left;
   padding-bottom: 15px;
  }
  ```

  + This declaration block will apply to all elements that have a class of box that are
    inside an element with an ID of container. 
  + It’s worth noting that the .box element doesn’t have to be an immediate child: there
    could be another element wrapping .box, and the styles would still apply. 

+ **vi) Child Combinator:**

  + A selector that uses the child combinator is similar to a selector that uses a
    descendant combinator, except it only targets immediate child elements.

  + ```
    #container > .box {
    float: left;
    padding-bottom: 15px;
    }
    ```
  + The selector will match all elements that have a class of box and that are immediate
    children of the #container element. 
    That means, unlike the descendant combinator, there can’t be another element wrapping .box—it has to be a direct child element.

+ **vii) General Sibling Combinator:**

  + A selector that uses a general sibling combinator matches elements based on 
    sibling relationships. 
    The selected elements are beside each other in the HTML.

  + ```
        h2 ~ p {
        margin-bottom: 20px;
        }
  ```

  + In this example, all paragraph elements (<p>) will be styled with the specified
   rules, but only if they are siblings of <h2> elements. 
   There could be other elements in between the <h2> and <p>, and the styles would still apply.

+ **viii) Adjacent Sibling Combinator:**
  
  + A selector that uses the adjacent sibling combinator uses the plus symbol (+), and 
    is almost the same as the general sibling selector. 
    The difference is that the targeted element must be an immediate sibling, not just a general sibling.

  +```
      p + p {
      text-indent: 1.5em;
      margin-bottom: 0;
    }
    ```
    
  + In this example will apply the specified styles only to paragraph elements that
    immediately follow other paragraph elements. 
    This means the first paragraph element on a page would not receive these styles. 
    Also, if another element appeared between two paragraphs, the second paragraph of 
    the two wouldn’t have the styles applied.

+ **ix) Attribute Selector:**
  
  + The attribute selector targets elements based on the presence and/or value of HTML
    attributes, and is declared using square brackets

  +```
    input[type="text"] {
    background-color: #444;
    width: 200px;
    }

    <input type="text">
  ```

+ **x) Pseudo-class:**
  
  + A pseudo-class uses a colon character to identify a pseudo-state that an element
    might be in—for example, the state of being hovered, or the state of being activated.

+ **xi) Pseudo-element:**

  + A CSS pseudo-element is used to style specified parts of an element. 
    For example, it can be used to:

      + Style the first letter, or line, of an element.
      + Insert content before, or after, the content of an element.

## 67.) What is a spread operator ?

---

## 67.) What is a spread operator ?

+ Spread operator allows iterables( arrays / objects / strings ) to be expanded into
  single arguments/elements. 
  Let's take an example to see this behavior,

+ ```
    function calculateSum(x, y, z) {
      return x + y + z;
    }

    const numbers = [1, 2, 3];

    console.log(calculateSum(...numbers)); // 6`
  ```

+ ```
      [..."John Resig"];

    The output of the array is ['J', 'o', 'h', 'n', '', 'R', 'e', 's', 'i', 'g'] Explanation: 
      The string is an iterable type and the spread operator within an array maps every character of an iterable to one element. 
      Hence, each character of a string becomes an element within an Array.
  ```

## 69.) What are template literals ? How do you write multi-line strings in template literals ?

+ Template literals or template strings are string literals allowing 
  embedded expressions. 
+ These are enclosed by the back-tick (`) character instead of double or single quotes.
  In E6, this feature enables using dynamic expressions as below,

+ ```
    var greeting = `Welcome to JS World, Mr. ${firstName} ${lastName}.`;
  ```

+ In ES5, you need break string like below,

    +```
    var greeting = 'Welcome to JS World, Mr. ' + firstName + ' ' + lastName.`
    ```
+ **Note**: You can use multi-line strings and string interpolation features with template literals.

+ In ES5, you would have to use newline escape characters('\n') and concatenation symbols
  (+) in order to get multi-line strings.

  +```
  console.log("This is string sentence 1\n" + "This is string sentence 2");
  ```

+ Whereas in ES6, You don't need to mention any newline sequence character,

+ ```
  console.log(`This is string sentence`
  `This is string sentence 2`);
  ```

---

## 71.) What is a rest parameter ?

+ Rest parameter is an improved way to handle function parameters which allows us to
  represent an indefinite number of arguments as an array. 
  
+ The syntax would be as below,
  ```
      function f(a, b, ...theArgs) {
        // ...
      }
  ```
+ For example, let's take a sum example to calculate on dynamic number of parameters,

  ```
      function total(…args){
      let sum = 0;
      for(let i of args){
      sum+=i;
      }
      return sum;
      }
      console.log(fun(1,2)); //3
      console.log(fun(1,2,3)); //6
      console.log(fun(1,2,3,4)); //13
      console.log(fun(1,2,3,4,5)); //15
  ```
+ **Note:** 
    + Rest parameter is added in ES2015 or ES6.
    + What happens if you do not use rest parameter as a last argument ?

      + The rest parameter should be the last argument, as its job is to collect 
        all the remaining arguments into an array. 
        For example, if you define a function like below it doesn’t make any sense and will throw an error.

      +
      ```
          function someFunc(a,…b,c){
          //You code goes here
          return;
          }
      ```

## 72.) How do you encode and decode an URL ?

+ The **encodeURI()** function is used to encode complete URI which has special characters
  except (, / ? : @ & = + $ #) characters.

+ 
  ```
    var uri = "https://mozilla.org/?x=шеллы";
    var encoded = encodeURI(uri);
    console.log(encoded); // https://mozilla.org/?x=%D1%88%D0%B5%D0%BB%D0%BB%D1%8B
  ```

+ The **decodeURI()** function is used to decode
  a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)
  previously created by encodeURI().

+ 
  ```
              var uri = "https://mozilla.org/?x=шеллы";

## 75.) What is the difference between Shallow and Deep copy ?

---

## 75.) What is the difference between Shallow and Deep copy ?

+ There are two ways to copy an object,


+ **Shallow Copy:**

  +  Shallow copy is a bitwise copy of an object. 
  +  A new object is created that has an exact copy of the values in the original
    object.
  + If any of the fields of the object are references to other objects, just the
    reference addresses are copied i.e., only the memory address is copied.

  +```Example

      var empDetails = {
        name: "John",
        age: 25,
        expertise: "Software Developer",
      };
    ```
  + to create a duplicate
    +
    ```
      var empDetailsShallowCopy = empDetails; //Shallow copying!
    ```
  + if we change some property value in the duplicate one like this:

    +
      ```
      empDetailsShallowCopy.name = "Johnson";
      ```
  
  + The above statement will also change the name of empDetails, since we have a shallow copy. That means we're losing the original data as well.

+ **Deep copy:**
  
  + A deep copy copies all fields, and makes copies of dynamically allocated memory
    pointed to by the fields.
  + A deep copy occurs when an object is copied along with the objects to which it refers.

  +
  ``` Example

    var empDetails = {
      name: "John",
      age: 25,
      expertise: "Software Developer",
    };
  ```

  + Create a deep copy by using the properties from the original object into new variable

  ```  
  var empDetailsDeepCopy = {
      name: empDetails.name,
      age: empDetails.age,
      expertise: empDetails.expertise,
    };
  ```
  
  + Now if you change empDetailsDeepCopy.name, it will only affect empDetailsDeepCopy &
    not empDetails.

## 78.) What is call stack ?

+ Call Stack is a data structure for javascript interpreters to keep track of 
  function calls(creates execution context) in the program. 
+ It has two major actions,

    + Whenever you call a function for its execution, you are pushing it to the stack.
    + Whenever the execution is completed, the function is popped out of the stack.

+ Let's take an example and it's state representation in a diagram format

  ```
      function hungry() {
        eatFruits();
      }
      function eatFruits() {
        return "I'm eating fruits";
      }

      // Invoke the `hungry` function
      hungry();
  ```

  + The above code processed in a call stack as below,

      + Add the hungry() function to the call stack list and execute the code.
      + Add the eatFruits() function to the call stack list and execute the code.
      + Delete the eatFruits() function from our call stack list.
      + Delete the hungry() function from the call stack list since there are no 
        items anymore.

  added to the call stack. 
  It is also known as the Callback Queue or Macrotask Queue.

+ Whenever the call stack receives an async function, it is moved into the Web API. 
  Based on the function, Web API executes it and awaits the result. 
  Once it is finished, it moves the callback into the event queue (the callback of the promise is moved into the microtask queue).

+ The event queue constantly checks whether or not the call stack is empty. 
  Once the call stack is empty and there is a callback in the event queue, the event queue moves the callback into the call stack.
  If there is a callback in the microtask queue as well, it is moved first. 
  The microtask queue has a higher priority than the event queue.

## 80.) What is modules in ES6 ?

+ Making objects, functions, classes or variables available to the outside world is 
  as simple as exporting them, and then importing them where needed in other files.

+**Benefits**

  + Code can be split into smaller files of self-contained functionality.
  + The same modules can be shared across any number of applications.
  + Ideally, modules need never be examined by another developer, because they’ve 
    has been proven to work.
  + Code referencing a module understands it's a dependency. 
    If the module file is changed or moved, the problem is immediately obvious.
  + Module code (usually) helps eradicate naming conflicts. 
    Function x() in module1 cannot clash with function x() in module2. 
    Options such as namespacing are employed so calls become module1.x() and module2.x().

+ Exporting:

+  ```
      export const myNumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];
      const animals = ['Panda', 'Bear', 'Eagle']; // Not available directly outside the module

      export function myLogger() {
        console.log(myNumbers, animals);
      }

      export class Alligator {
        constructor() {
          // ...
        }
      }
  
  ```

+ Exporting with alias:

    +
    ```
      export { myNumbers, myLogger as Logger, Alligator }
    ```

+ Default export:

+ ```
  export const myNumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];
  const animals = ['Panda', 'Bear', 'Eagle'];

  export default function myLogger() {
  console.log(myNumbers, pets);
  }

  export class Alligator {
    constructor() {
    // ...
    }
  }

## 81.) What are the differences between cookie, local storage and session storage ?

+ **Cookie:**

    + Accessed on client or server side - Both server-side & client-side.
    + Lifetime - As configured using Expires option
    + SSL support - Supported
    + Maximum data size - 4KB

    + A cookie is a piece of data that is stored on your computer to be accessed by 
      your browser. 
    + Cookies are saved as key/value pairs. For example, you can create a cookie 
      named username as below,
      ```
        document.cookie = "username=John";
      ```
    +    webBrowser → REQUEST → server
         webBrowser ← REQUEST + COOKIE ← server
         webBrowser → REQUEST + COOKIE → server

    + Cookies are used to remember information about the user profile(such as username). 
      It basically involves two steps,

        + When a user visits a web page, the user profile can be stored in a cookie.
        + Next time the user visits the page, the cookie remembers the user profile.

    + There are few below options available for a cookie,

        + By default, the cookie is deleted when the browser is closed but you can 
          change this behavior by setting expiry date (in UTC time).

        + ```
              document.cookie = "username=John; expires=Sat, 8 Jun 2019 12:00:00 UTC";
          ```

        + By default, the cookie belongs to a current page. But you can tell the 
          browser what path the cookie belongs to using a path parameter.

        + ```
              document.cookie = "username=John; path=/services";
          ```
    
    + You can delete a cookie by setting the expiry date as a passed date. 
      You don't need to specify a cookie value in this case. 
      For example, you can delete a username cookie in the current page as below.

        + ```
        document.cookie ="username=; expires=Fri, 07 Jun 2019 00:00:00 UTC; path=/;";
          ```

    + **Note:** 

    You should define the cookie path option to ensure that you delete the right cookie. 
    Some browsers doesn't allow to delete a cookie unless you specify a path parameter.

+ **Local storage:**

    + Accessed on client or server side - client-side only.
    + Lifetime - until deleted.
    + SSL support - Not supported.
    + Maximum data size - 5 MB

    + LocalStorage is the same as SessionStorage but it persists the data even when 
      the browser is closed and reopened(i.e it has no expiration time) 
      whereas in sessionStorage data gets cleared when the page session ends.
    
    + Local storage: It stores data for current origin with no expiration date.

    + The Window object implements the WindowLocalStorage objects which has localStorage
      (window.localStorage). 
      These properties create an instance of the Storage object, through which data items can be set, retrieved and removed for a specific domain and storage type (local). For example, you can read and write on local storage objects as below

    + ```
        localStorage.setItem("logo", document.getElementById("logo").value);
        localStorage.getItem("logo");
      ```

+ **Session storage:**

    + Accessed on client or server side - client-side only.
    + Lifetime - until tab is closed.
    + SSL support - Not supported.
    + Maximum data size - 5 MB.

    + Session storage: 
      It stores data for one session and the data is lost when the browser tab is closed.

    + The session storage provided methods for reading, writing and clearing the 
      session data.
    
    + 
    ```
      // Save data to sessionStorage
      sessionStorage.setItem("key", "value");

      // Get saved data from sessionStorage
      let data = sessionStorage.getItem("key");

      // Remove saved data from sessionStorage
      sessionStorage.removeItem("key");

      // Remove all saved data from sessionStorage
      sessionStorage.clear();
    ```

## 82.) What is a callback hell ?

+ Callback Hell is an anti-pattern with multiple nested callbacks which makes code hard
  to read and debug when dealing with asynchronous logic. 
  The callback hell looks like below,

+ ```
      async1(function(){
          async2(function(){
              async3(function(){
                  async4(function(){

## 83.) What is a strict mode in javascript ? Why do you need strict mode ?

---

## 83.) What is a strict mode in javascript ? Why do you need strict mode ?

+ Strict Mode is a new feature in ECMAScript 5 that allows you to place a program, 
  or a function, in a “strict” operating context. 
+ This way it prevents certain actions from being taken and throws more exceptions. 
+ The literal expression "use strict"; instructs the browser to use the javascript code
  in the Strict mode.

+ Strict mode is useful to write "secure" JavaScript by notifying "bad syntax" into 
  real errors. 
+ For example, it eliminates accidentally creating a global variable by throwing an error
  and also throws an error for assignment to a non-writable property, a getter-only property, a non-existing property, a non-existing variable, or a non-existing object.

+ The strict mode is declared by adding "use strict"; to the beginning of a script 
  or a function. 
+ If declared at the beginning of a script, it has global scope.

+ ```
        "use strict";
      x = 3.14; // This will cause an error because x is not declared
  ```

+ And if you declare inside a function, it has local scope.

+ ```
      x = 3.14; // This will not cause an error.
      myFunction();

      function myFunction() {
        "use strict";
        y = 3.14; // This will cause an error
      }
  ```

## 84.) What is the difference between window and document ?

+**Window**

  + It is the root level element in any web page.
  + By default window object is available implicitly in the page.
  + It has methods like alert(), confirm() and properties like document, location.

+**Document**

  + It is the direct child of the window object. This is also known as 
    Document Object Model(DOM).
  + You can access it via window.document or document.
  + It provides methods like getElementById, getElementsByTagName, createElement etc.

## 85.) What is an event flow ?

---

## 85.) What is an event flow ?

+ Event flow is the order in which event is received on the web page. 
+ When you click an element that is nested in various other elements, 
  before your click actually reaches its destination, or target element, 
  it must trigger the click event for each of its parent elements first, 
  starting at the top with the global window object. There are two ways of event flow

    + Top to Bottom(Event Capturing)
    + Bottom to Top (Event Bubbling)

## 86.) What is event capturing ?

+ Event capturing is a type of event propagation where the event is first captured 
  by the outermost element, and then successively triggers on the descendants (children) of the target element in the same nesting hierarchy till it reaches the innermost DOM element.

## 88.) What are the pros and cons of promises over callbacks ?

+ Below are the list of pros and cons of promises over callbacks,

+**Pros:**

  + It avoids callback hell which is unreadable
  + Easy to write sequential asynchronous code with .then()
  + Easy to write parallel asynchronous code with Promise.all()
  + Solves some of the common problems of callbacks(call the callback too late, 
    too early, many times and swallow errors/exceptions)

+**Cons:**

  + It makes little complex code
  + You need to load a polyfill if ES6 is not supported

## 89.) What is BOM ?

+ The Browser Object Model (BOM) allows JavaScript to "talk to" the browser. 
  It consists of the objects navigator, history, screen, location and document which are children of the window.
  The Browser Object Model is not standardized and can change based on different browsers.

+ window → DOM → document
         → BOM → frames, history, location, XMLHttpRequest
         → Javascript → Object, Array, Function

## 90.) What are break and continue statements ?

---

## 90.) What are break and continue statements ?

+ The break statement is used to "jump out" of a loop. i.e, 
  It breaks the loop and continues executing the code after the loop.

+ ```
      for (i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        if (i === 5) {
          break;
        }
        text += "Number: " + i + "<br>";
      }
  ```

+ The continue statement is used to "jump over" one iteration in the loop. i.e, 
  It breaks one iteration (in the loop), if a specified condition occurs, and continues with the next iteration in the loop.

+ ```
      for (i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        if (i === 5) {
          continue;
        }
        text += "Number: " + i + "<br>";
      }

---

## 91.) What is tree shaking ? What is the need of it ?

+ Tree shaking is a form of dead code elimination. 
+ It means that unused modules will not be included in the bundle during the 
  build process and for that it relies on the static structure of ES2015 module syntax,( i.e. import and export). 
+ Initially this has been popularized by the ES2015 module bundler rollup.

+ Tree Shaking can significantly reduce the code size in any application. 
+ i.e, The less code we send over the wire the more performant the application will be. 
+ For example, if we just want to create a “Hello World” Application using 
  SPA frameworks then it will take around a few MBs, but by tree shaking it can bring down the size to just a few hundred KBs. 
+ Tree shaking is implemented in Rollup and Webpack bundlers.

## 92.) What is the difference between proto and prototype ?

---

## 92.) What is the difference between proto and prototype ?

+ The __proto__ object is the actual object that is used in the lookup chain to 
  resolve methods, etc.
+ Whereas prototype is the object that is used to build __proto__ when you create 
  an object with new.
+ ```
  new Employee().__proto__ === Employee.prototype;
  new Employee().prototype === undefined;
  ```
+ **Prototype:**
      + Access - All the function constructors have prototype properties.
      + Purpose - Used to reduce memory wastage with a single copy of function.
      + ECMAScript - Introduced in ES6
      + Usage - Frequently used

+ **proto**
      + All the objects have __proto__ property
      + Used in lookup chain to resolve methods, constructors etc.
      + Introduced in ES5
      + Rarely used

## 93.) What is promise.all() ?

---

## 93.) What is promise.all() ?

+ Promise.all is a promise that takes an array of promises as an input (an iterable), 
  and it gets resolved when all the promises get resolved or any one of them gets rejected.

+ ```

  Promise.all([Promise1, Promise2, Promise3]) 
        .then(result) => {   
            console.log(result) 
          } 
        .catch(error => console.log(`Error in promises ${error}`));

  ```

+ **Note:**
  Remember that the order of the promises(output the result) is maintained as per 
  input order.

## 94.) Why is JavaScript treated as Single threaded ?

+ JavaScript is a single-threaded language. 
+ Because the language specification does not allow the programmer to write code so 
  that the interpreter can run parts of it in parallel in multiple threads or processes.
+ Whereas languages like java, go, C++ can make multi-threaded and multi-process programs.

## 95.) What is the purpose of setTimeout and clearTimeout method ?

---

## 95.) What is the purpose of setTimeout and clearTimeout method ?

+ The setTimeout() method is used to call a function or evaluates an expression after 
  a specified number of milliseconds. 
+ For example, let us log a message after 2 seconds using setTimeout method,
+ ```
      setTimeout(function() { console.log("Good morning"); }, 2000);
  ```

+ The clearTimeout() function is used in javascript to clear the timeout which has been
  set by setTimeout() function before that. 
+ i.e, The return value of setTimeout() function is stored in a variable and it’s passed
  into the clearTimeout() function to clear the timer. 
+ For example, the below setTimeout method is used to display the message after 3
  seconds. 
+ This timeout can be cleared by clearTimeout() method.

+ ```
      var msg;
      function greeting() {
        alert('Good morning');
      }
      function start() {
        msg =setTimeout(greeting, 3000);
      }
      function stop() {
          clearTimeout(msg);
      }
  ```

---

## 96.)  What is the purpose of setInterval and clearInterval method  ?

+ The setInterval() method is used to call a function or evaluates an expression at
  specified intervals (in milliseconds). 
+ For example, let us log a message after 2 seconds using setInterval method,

+ ```
      setInterval(function() { console.log("Good morning"); }, 2000);
  ```


+ The clearInterval() function is used in javascript to clear the interval which has been set by setInterval() function. 
+ i.e, The return value returned by setInterval() function is stored in a variable and it’s passed into the clearInterval() function to clear the interval. 
+ For example, the below setInterval method is used to display the message for every 3 seconds. 
+ This interval can be cleared by clearInterval() method.

+ ```
        var msg;
        function greeting() {
          alert('Good morning');
        }
        function start() {
          msg = setInterval(greeting, 3000);
        }
        function stop() {

## 97.) What is a pure function ?

---

## 97.) What is a pure function ?

+ Pure functions are functions that accept an input and returns a value without modifying any data outside its scope(Side Effects). 

+ Its output or return value must depend on the input/arguments and pure functions must return a value.

+ ```Example:
      function impure(arg) {
          finalR.s = 90
          return arg * finalR.s
      }
  ```

+ The above function is not a pure function because it modified a state finalR.s outside its scope.

+ ```
      function pure(arg) {
            return arg * 4
        }
  ```

+ Here is a pure function. It didn’t side effect
  any external state and it returns an output based on the input.

  + A function must pass two tests to be
    considered “pure”:

    1.) Same inputs always return same outputs
    2.) No side-effects

+ **1. Same Input => Same Output** Compare this:

+ ```

  const add = (x, y) => x + y;

  add(2, 4); // 6

  // To this

  let x = 2;

  const add = (y) => {
    x += y;
  };

  add(4); // x === 6 (the first time);

  ```

+ **2. Pure Functions = Consistent Results** 
  The first example returns a value based on the given parameters, regardless of where/when you call it.

  + If you pass 2 and 4, you’ll always get 6.

  + Nothing else affects the output.

  + Benefits

    + One of the major benefits of using pure functions is they are immediately testable. They will always produce the same result if you pass in the same arguments.

    + The pure functions are easier to
      parallelize
    + They also makes maintaining and
      refactoring code much easier.

## 98.) Is JavaScript a compiled or interpreted language ?

+ JavaScript is an interpreted language, not a compiled language. 
+ An interpreter in the browser reads over the JavaScript code, interprets each line, and runs it.
+ Nowadays modern browsers use a technology known as Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation, which compiles JavaScript to executable bytecode just as it is about to run.

## 99.) When to use reduce(), map(), foreach() and filter() in JavaScript ?

---

## 99.) When to use reduce(), map(), foreach() and filter() in JavaScript ?

+ **forEach()**

  + It takes a callback function and run that
    callback function on each element of array
    one by one.

  + Basically forEach works as a traditional for
    loop looping over the array and providing
    array elements to do operations on them.

  + ```
      var arr = [10, 20, 30];

      arr.forEach(function (elem, index){
        console.log(elem + ' comes at ' + index);
      })

      // Output:

      10 comes at 0
      20 comes at 1
      30 comes at 2

    ```

+ **filter()**

  + The main difference between forEach() and filter() is that forEach just loop over the array and executes the callback but filter executes the callback and check its return value. 
  + If the value is true element remains in the resulting array but if the return value is false the element will be removed for the resulting array.

  +*Note:* filter does not update the existing array it will return a new filtered array every time.

  +```
    var arr = [10, 20, 30];

    var result = arr.filter(function(elem){
        return elem !== 20;
    })
    console.log(result)

    // Output:

    [10, 30]
    ```

+ **map()**

  + map() like filter() & forEach() takes a callback and run it against every element on the array but whats makes it unique is it generate a new array based on your existing array.

  + Like filter(), map() also returns an array. The provided callback to map modifies the array elements and save them into the new array upon completion that array get returned as the mapped array.

  +```
      var arr = [10, 20, 30];

      var mapped = arr.map(function(elem) {
        return elem * 10;
      });
      console.log(mapped)

    // Output:

    [100, 200, 300]

    ```

+ **reduce()**

  + reduce() method of the array object is used
    to reduce the array to one single value.

  +```
      var arr = [10, 20, 30];

      var sum = arr.reduce(function(sum, elem) {
          return sum + elem;
      });
      console.log(sum); // Output: 60
  ```

## 100.) What is a first class function ?

---

## 100.) What is a first class function ?

+ JavaScript functions are first-class functions meaning functions and objects are treated as the same thing. 
+ Functions can be stored as a variable inside an object or an array as well as it can be passed as an argument or be returned by another function. 
+ That makes function "first-class citizens in JavaScript"

+ ```
  // Example: Assign a function to a variable

      const message = function() {
      console.log("Hello World!");
      }

      message(); // Invoke it using the variable

  // Example: Pass a function as an Argument

      function sayHello() {
        return "Hello, ";
      }
      function greeting(helloMessage, name) {
        console.log(helloMessage() + name);
      }
      // Pass `sayHello` as an argument to `greeting` function
      greeting(sayHello, "JavaScript!");

  // Example: Return a function

      function sayHello() {
        return function() {
            console.log("Hello!");
        }
      }

  // Example: Using a variable

      const sayHello = function() {
        return function() {
            console.log("Hello!");
        }
      }
      const myFunc = sayHello();
      myFunc(); 

  // Example: Using double parentheses

      function sayHello() {
        return function() {
            console.log("Hello!");
        }
      }
      sayHello()();

  //We are using double parentheses ()() to invoke the returned function as well.
  ```
